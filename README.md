A very simple script to derive component values for a voltage-controlled regulator circuit, built around the Texas Instruments LP2951. The equation + more info on the circuit can be found here - https://www.edn.com/create-a-versatile-voltage-controlled-voltage-regulator-based-on-the-lp2951/

Honestly I just got sick of doing this equation every time I needed to change components. The script returns values for K, R1, R2, and checks if the equation conditions have been met.
